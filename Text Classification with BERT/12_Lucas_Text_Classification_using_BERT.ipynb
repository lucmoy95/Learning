    "## Intro to Natural Language Processing (NLP)\n",
    "Natural language processing (NLP) is a subfield of computer science, linguistics and artificial intelligence, which focuses on the way computers interact with natural human language. It encompasses a collection of techniques which aids computers in understanding the natural human language. These techniques extracts meaning and grammatical structures from varying levels of human language:\n",

    "The BERT model is a natural language processing model proposed by researchers in Google Research in 2018 (https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805). It is a pre-trained language model which can be applied to a variety of NLP tasks. The proposed BERT model achieved state-of-the-art performance in a string of NLP tasks. It operates on the premises of transfer learning. "

    "## BERT Architecture\n",
    "In essence, the BERT model is a multi-layer stack of transformer architectures. Transformers are encoder-decoder networks in which every output is connected to the input, and the connection is dynamically calculated based upon their connection. For more information on transformers, please refer to this paper (https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). In the original BERT paper (as mentioned above), there are two versions of the BERT architecture, that is BERT<sub><sup>LARGE</sup></sub> which has 24 layers of encoder stack and BERT<sub><sup>BASE</sub></sup> with 12 layers of encoder stacks. The stacks of transformer architecture in BERT is illustrated below:\n",

    "\n",
    "### Encoder layers\n",
    "The encoder layers consists of two sub-layers which are the multi-head self attention mechanism and the feed forward neural network layers. The attention mechanism is used to know which word in the context better contributes to the current word. The multi-head self attention mechanism works by computing a key-value and query vector for every input token in a sequence, which will be further used to create a weighted representation (for more information on the calculation, please refer to this link: https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2019/06/understanding-transformers-nlp-state-of-the-art-models/?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=demystifying-bert-groundbreaking-nlp-framework). This allows BERT to learn contextual relation between words. Subsequently, the output of the multi-head self attention mechanism is fed to the feed forward neural network. Each sub-layer in the transformer encoder is connected through residual connection and the output of each sub-layer is normalized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoder layers\n",
    "The decoder layers consists of the same sub-layers in the encoder layers, with an additional layer which performs multi-head attention on the output of the encoder layers. This additional layer helps decoder focus on appropriate parts of the sentence. \n",

    "## Bidirectionality\n",
    "The BERT model also distinguishes itself from previous language models due to it's bidirectionality. This is achieved through the pre-training objectives of \"Masked Language Modelling\" (MLM). The MLM task involves pre-training the model to predict a randomly selected masked word from the input sentence. The use of the MLM pre-training objective allows the BERT model to process text from both left to right and right to left, enabling it to gain more contextual information from the surrounding words in a sequence. As opposed to previous language models, which can only process text from left to right. "
